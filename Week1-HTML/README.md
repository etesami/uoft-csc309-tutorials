# CSC309 Tutorials: Week 1 (HTML)
Welcome to the CSC309 tutorials week 1. In this exercise, we will build a simple two pages website in four sections. The goal is to have a website like the image below after the end of week 2. This week, you work only on building the structure of the page and its contents. The next week we will start working on style.

### Section 1: Building the structure of the main page
An HTML document (or webpage, which means the same thing) requires a specific structure to be valid. In this section you will work on `section1.html` and order the HTML tags to represent a valid empty HTML page. 

### Section 2: Populating contents of the main
Having the `section1.html` ready, you now start to populate the contents. Open the `section2.html` and try to find the place in `section1.html` to put contents from `section2.html`. 

### Section 3: Building the structure of the order page
This section is similar to section 1. You will work on `section3.html` and order the HTML tags to represent a valid empty HTML page. 

### Section 4: Populating contents of order page
Like section 2, you now use `section4.html` file and try to find the best place in `section3.html` to put contents.
